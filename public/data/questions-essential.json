    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Client money rules govern money held by an authorised firm that belongs to a client, held in a client account. Money held by a firm is either 'client money' or 'firm's money'. Within a delivery versus payment, if the money is due within three business days it is not necessary to count the money as client money. Once it is paid to a client then the money ceases to be client money. Although there is no obligation to pay interest on client money, if interest is paid, it needs to be treated as client money. If money has been paid to a client, then it has left the firm's control and is now no longer client money"
