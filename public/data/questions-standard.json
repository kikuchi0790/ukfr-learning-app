        "text": ". Firms cannot usually be disciplined for not following the regulations if they follow the JMLSG guidelines"
      }
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The JMLSG guidelines provide an indication of what is expected of financial sector firms and, when tailored by a firm to its own risk base and business profile. The law is prescribed by the proceeds of crime act (POCA), which has nothing to do with the FCA. Also, do not confuse the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (MLR 2017), which is also law, with FCA regulations, which is not law. FCA money laundering regulations (contained in SYSC) provide admin provisions for firms at risk - ie, they tell them what controls they should use in order to reduce their risk exposure. SYSC are regulations, rather than the law, ie they are not statute. JMLSG (guidance) then advises firms on how best to implement the FCA's money laundering regulations. Guidance is not 'binding'. This means that it is not mandatory and the firm does not have to follow it. However, these guidance notes have been accepted by HMT, so in following them you could not be considered in breach of the FCA's regulations. If the firm does not follow the guidance, this protection is lost."
